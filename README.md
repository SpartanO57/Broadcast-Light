<h1>What is This?</h1>
<p> This is a little box that im working on that will turn on when "ON THE AIR" for streamers and content creators. as of this writing we are currently on Version 0.3. Future plans include an iOS/Android Control app, Bluetooth remote control, and Youtube liveStream displaying.</p>

<h1>How is this planned to be implemented?</h1>
<p> The Current plan is to build the first protype using Rasberry pi, an LED Board, LEDs, and of course the code being actively developed in this github. Currently there is a secound style of box being designed but untill that is ready to have a portotype build we will just concentrate on the LED Version on the box.</p>
